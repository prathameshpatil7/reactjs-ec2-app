# üöÄ Full-Stack Application Deployment with CI/CD

This project demonstrates the end-to-end deployment of a **full-stack application** (React.js frontend + Node.js backend) using **Docker**, **GitHub Actions**, and **AWS EC2**. It ensures consistency, scalability, and automation by leveraging modern DevOps practices.

## üåü Features

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated builds, testing, and deployment using GitHub Actions.  
- **Dockerized Applications**: Both React.js frontend and Node.js backend are containerized for consistent environments.  
- **AWS Deployment**: Hosted the full-stack application on AWS EC2 with high scalability.  
- **Nginx Integration**: Used Nginx to serve React static files and manage reverse proxy for the backend.  
- **Database Management**: Node.js backend seamlessly communicates with a MongoDB database.

## üìú Architecture Overview

Here‚Äôs how the architecture is structured:  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c2fbea7-2783-48ad-87d1-19c482ae1fad)

1. **Frontend (React.js)**: Built using React and served as static files through Nginx.  
2. **Backend (Node.js)**: Runs on Express.js and communicates with the MongoDB database.  
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated with GitHub Actions to build, push Docker images, and deploy to AWS.  
4. **AWS EC2**: Both frontend and backend containers are hosted on AWS EC2 instances.

## üñ•Ô∏è Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js & npm  
- Docker installed on your local machine  
- AWS account with EC2 access  
- MongoDB instance  

### Steps to Run Locally
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo

2. **Build Docker Images**  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the Application**  
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:80`  
   - Backend API: `http://localhost:9000`

## ü§ñ CI/CD Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline is powered by **GitHub Actions**:
1. **Trigger**: On every push to the main branch.  
2. **Build**: Docker images for both frontend and backend are built.  
3. **Push**: Docker images are pushed to Docker Hub.  
4. **Deploy**: The updated containers are deployed to AWS EC2.
